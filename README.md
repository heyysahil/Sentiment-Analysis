# Sentiment-Analysis using BERT and XAI

## Sentiment Analysis on Social Media using BERT and XAI

## Explainable AI
Explainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of methodologies, techniques, and tools designed to make the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models understandable to humans. As AI systems become increasingly complex and integral to various aspects of society—ranging from healthcare and finance to autonomous vehicles and social media—there's a growing need to ensure that their operations are transparent, trustworthy, and accountable. XAI addresses this need by providing insights into how AI models arrive at their conclusions, enabling users to comprehend, trust, and effectively manage AI-driven outcomes.


## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a crucial natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This project leverages BERT-based transformers to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts, specifically tweets. Additionally, Explainable AI (XAI) tools like LIME are utilized to interpret the model's predictions, providing insights into which words or phrases most influence sentiment classification.
